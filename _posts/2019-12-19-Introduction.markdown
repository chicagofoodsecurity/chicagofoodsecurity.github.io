If you ask some elderlies, they may say a little dirt never killed anybody. But recently food safety has become a more and more serious issue all around the world especially considering eating outside. Therefore, inspections are performed by staff from the Chicago Department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program using a standardized procedure. Thanks to Kaggle’s data platform, we can get a sense of the sanitary performance of the food establishments in Chicago with the results of the inspection and possibly understand the food hygiene condition all over the world through this small state.

- [Chicago Food Inspection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-food-inspections) This website includes inspections of restaurants and other food establishments in Chicago from January 1, 2010 to the present.

## Research Questions
- How is the overall sanitary condition of Chicago’s food related-facilities? 

- How does inspection’s result correlate to the inspection’s type and frequency? Are re-inspection ratio and fail ratio correlated? What are the inspection frequency distribution of different risk types?

- What is the relationships between risks and results? How do the results of each risk type of different facility types evolve over time?

- Do adjacent months have similar results and risk types? Are certain kinds of violation have a clustering effect and tend to occur simultaneously?
