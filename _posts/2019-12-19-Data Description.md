# Sanitary Conditions of Food Establishments
Here, we use the pass rate to represent sanitary conditions of food establishments.
Pass rate is defined as numbers of pass and pass with condition over numbers of all results using results from all inspection types except license and license re-inspection since these kinds of inspection are announced, thus it's more like a pre inspection while others are unannounced.  

## Changes over facility type
The types are facilities are various, but there are only a few common types of facilities: Nearly 130,000 facilities are identified as 'Restaurant'. Grocery store and school are also common facilities. These three types of facilities account for over 90% of all facilities.

The proportions of inspections results for different facility types are similar. Most of the facility types have a overall pass rate which include result pass and pass with conditions of 60% to 80%. Among all the facility types, school, hospital and shared kitchen have relatively high pass rates. The outlier is type unknown, whose results are mostly license suspended.

## Changes over facility type
How does food sanity condition correlate to district?  
We draw a pass rate for districts. There are considerable differences between the pass rates of different districts of Chicago. In the east of the city, which is the city center with the highest facility density, pass rates are above 60%, so the sanitary condition is generally satisfactory. In contrast, on the west side where there are also lots of facilities, the pass rates are only about 45%. In addition, some districts in the north and south part of Chicago also have a clustering effect of low pass rates.

## Changes over time
How does food sanity condition correlate to time?  
To answer this question, we performed analysis yearly and monthly. From the stack plot, a sudden decrease happened between 2017 and 2018, which might due to the changes of inspection methods in 1/7/2018. It's said their new inspection methods may be more stricter than the previous one. Besides, pass rate and fail rate basicly keep the same over years, except for 2012 where had a relatively low pass rate and relatively hight fail rate. For the changes between 2017 and 2018, we would discuss it later.
