# Conclusion

The data story contains the contention of our project. We mainly show the most representatives in our story, including descriptive statistics in inspections, inspection effectiveness evaluation and some basic analysis of violations. 

#### 1. Several proofs have been verified to make the conclusion that inspections are effective in general. Despite that, the inspection frequency corresponding to the specific "risk" type did reach designed frequency. For example, "risk 1(high)" does have a higher pass-rate compared to others with a higher inspection frequency.  

#### 2. As for the new violation code, although it's hard to use it to infer the severity, we can somehow verify the effectiveness of the changing violation category.
