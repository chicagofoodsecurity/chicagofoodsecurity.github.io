# Food Insecurity in Chicago
food insecurity is the condition where people cannot reliably access adequate, nutritious food.

## What should you care?
If you care about sustainability, you should care about food security!
The Environment: The quality and amount of land available for growing food is declining. Also, the oil and gas used to transport food long distances contributes to poorer air quality.
Equity: Everyone everywhere should have access to healthy food that will promote their well being. We should end hunger.
Economy & Health: Improved health is beneficial to health expenses and the overall economy.  

## Who does this affect?
80% of a city’s sewage is contributed by food system activities.
25% of fossil fuel use and air pollution is attributable to food production, processing, and transport (University of Southern California).

According to the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), "a day’s worth of the most healthy diet patterns cost about $1.50 more per day than the least healthy ones."
Though this seems inexpensive, this is almost $550 more per year. This could be a burden for some families, especially the working poor.
